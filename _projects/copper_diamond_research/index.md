## Roles and Responsibilities
- Supported Experimental research on copper-diamond composite materials as poart of an advanced thermal management study.
- Prepared and processed material samples using electrodeposition under faculty supervision.
- Conducted hands-on lab work including making eletrolyte solutions, electrodeposition, and post-processing.
- Collaborated with supervisors to plan experiments and troubleshoot technical challenges.
- Maintained detailed experimental logs, data sheets, and test plans to support research reproducibility.

## Design and Development

### Experimentation & Analysis
- Optimization of the electroplating process to be as energy efficient as possible through various tests.
- Testing the thermal conductivity of the sample through well documented and structured lab procedures.
