## Roles and Responsibilities
- Independently led the full mechanical design of the project from concept to final production drawings.
- Collaborated with a Supervisor to review design decisions, and refine concepts through multiple design review meetings.
- Integrated feedback and implemented design solutions based on technical discussions.
- Created detailed manufacturing/ assembly drawings with appropriate tolerances and GD&T.
- Ensured all components were designed for manufacturability and practical assembly.

## Design and Development

##Mechanical Design Overview
- Redesigned a manual fabric winder into a semi-automatic system to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.
- Modified a compression roller to maintain consistent fabric tension during winding.
- Added guide arms to align fabric edges and guide the core as the roll grows.
- Implented a side cutter mechanism for clean edge trimming during operation.
- Ensured all components were compatible with existing infrastructure and manufacturable.

### Challenges and Solutions
- Edge Alignment
- Structural Integrity
- Compatability
- Cutter Speed and Wiring Guide

### Tools and Technology Used
- Autodesk Inventor - 3D modelling, full assembly layout, technical drawings, FEA
- Hand Calculations - Sizing mechanical components
- Design Reviews - Iterative feedback and refinement
