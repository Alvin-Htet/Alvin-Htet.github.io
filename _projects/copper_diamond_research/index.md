## Roles and Responsibilities
- Supported Experimental research on copper-diamond composite materials as poart of an advanced thermal management study.
- Prepared and processed material samples using electrodeposition under faculty supervision.
- Conducted hands-on lab work including making eletrolyte solutions, electrodeposition, and post-processing.
- Collaborated with supervisors to plan experiments and troubleshoot technical challenges.
- Maintained detailed experimental logs, data sheets, and test plans to support research reproducibility.

## Design and Development

### Experimentation & Analysis
- Redesigned a manual fabric winder into a semi-automatic system to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention.
- Modified a compression roller to maintain consistent fabric tension during winding.
- Added guide arms to align fabric edges and guide the core as the roll grows.
- Implented a side cutter mechanism for clean edge trimming during operation.
- Ensured all components were compatible with existing infrastructure and manufacturable.

### Challenges and Solutions
- Consistency and Reproducibility: Noting down minute details and record actions to minimize deviation and inconsistencies.
- Contamination Detection: Occational Checking of Contamination on electroplating area and electrolyte liquid surface.
- Lack of Specific Equipment: Designing custom lab equipment for increased productivity.
- Efficiency & Process Speed: Push how fast the composite can be processed by supplying more energy and testing results.

### Tools and Technology Used
- 3D Modelling & Printing - Solidworks, Orca, Cura
- Material Manufacturing - Electrodeposition, 3D Printing
- Testing Equipment - XRD, Thermocouples
- Software - MATLAB, Excel, Origin
