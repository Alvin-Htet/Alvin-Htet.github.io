## Roles and Responsibilities
- Independently led the full mechanical design of the project from concept to final production drawings.
- Collaborated with a Supervisor to review design decisions, and refine concepts through multiple design review meetings.
- Integrated feedback and implemented design solutions based on technical discussions.
- Created detailed manufacturing/ assembly drawings with appropriate tolerances and GD&T.
- Ensured all components were designed for manufacturability and practical assembly.

## Mechanical Design Overview
- Redesigned a fabric winder into a semi-automatic system to accomodate winding of wider fabrics.
- Calculated and verified the strength of the welded frame extension to be safe and strong. 
- Designed safety guards for operator safety.
- 3D modelled existing frame by deriving information from pictures and 2D drawings.
- Ensured all components were compatible with existing infrastructure and manufacturable.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Structural Intigrity: Calculation and analysis of stresses.
- Ease of Assembly: Communication with manufacturing plant managers and machinists.

## Tools and Technology Used
- Autodesk Inventor - 3D modelling, full assembly layout, technical drawings, FEA
- Hand Calculations - Sizing mechanical components
- Design Reviews - Iterative feedback and refinement
